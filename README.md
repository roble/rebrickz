# Rebrickz

Rebrickz is a brick-breaker game based on Ballz style. I started developing this game to learn how to use Typescript and Phaser3.

I created all the code, styling and graphics using Figma.

Please feel free to use it, however, if you want to use the code, don't hesitate to give me credit. 

## Demo

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command          | Description                                                                     |

| `npm install`    | Install project dependencies                                                    |
| `npm start`      | Build project and open web server running project                               |
| `npm run build`  | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |
| `npm run deploy` | Deploy the code to github pages                                                 |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:3000` by default).
