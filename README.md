# Rebrickz

Rebrickz is a brick breaker game based on Ballz style. I started develop this game with the intention of learning how to use Typescript and Phaser3.

All the code, styling and graphics were created by me.

Feel free to use, however, if you want to use the code, please make sure to give me credit.

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command          | Description                                                                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`    | Install project dependencies                                                    |
| `npm start`      | Build project and open web server running project                               |
| `npm run build`  | Builds code bundle with production settings (minification, uglification, etc..) |
| `npm run deploy` | Deploy the code to github pages                                                 |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm start`.

After starting the development server with `npm start`, you can edit any files in the `src` folder and webpack will automatically recompile and reload your server (available at `http://localhost:3000` by default).
